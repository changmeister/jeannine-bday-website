                    <p>Happy 21st Birthday love! It has truly been a blessing getting to meet you and get to know you over the past few months. You are such a vibrant, genuine, and caring person, and that's why I like you so much and am so proud to call you my girlfriend üíë. I have enjoyed every moment with you, whether that be
                         through text, call, or in person. Through text, one of my favorite memories was when UCLA played UMICH in March Madness üèÄ and we were frantically texting as the game came down to the wire. I also really enjoyed when we elaborately planned and executed our fake proposal at 2 AM üíç. In call, 
                         a few of my favorite memories were when we went through questions we found online and really got to know each other. I also loved all of our study dates üìö and enjoyed when we tested each other's typing (which I'm obviously superior and will never help you at). In person, I really enjoyed Six Flags üö© and going on all
                         of the roller coasters with you (BESIDES GOLIATH). I also loved playing basketball with you, getting kbbq, cuddling, among a host of other things. I hope you have an AMAZING day, one as amazing as you!</p>
